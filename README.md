# BullshitBingo

## The Rules
The Rules are pretty simple: On your Bingo card, there are 25 phrases. Try and collect 5 either in a row or a column. When you're done, stand up and shout "Bullshit!", or just sit and smurk silently :)

## About the game
Version 0.1 of the game has a fixed list of words, from which a card is generated.
The winning patterns are fixed to horizontal and vertical sequences of 5 words.
States are currently not saved, reloading the view will create a new card and you will loose your progress.
All of the above will be changed in the next version.
